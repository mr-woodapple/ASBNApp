# ASBN App
A Blazor Web Assembly app that allows you to write your mandatory apprenticeship report book with ease. The aim is to be able to quickly add a note for a day before forgetting about it, and when the time has come, you can export a ready-to-go pdf with the information you entered sometime before.

The app uses a custom API to handle storing the data in an SQL database. Authentication is handled using ASP.NET Core Identity. There's also a legacy version available that uses JSON to store data - simply check-out "legacy-version" to access that.
